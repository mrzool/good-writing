### 1. Be an avid reader

The first and most important rule. Reading the works of great writers gets you to absorb "a vast inventory of words, idioms, constructions, tropes and rethorical tricks" and helps you develop a sense of how good writing works.

### 2. Use vivid imagery

Abstractions are often tedious and laborious for the human brain to handle. To make your writing pleasant and get your point across, use physical, vivid and concrete images instead. Spice up your writing by using unusual words occasionally. Use [phonaestetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonaesthetics) and be aware of its power. If you need to write about an abstract idea, make it alive with metaphors, analogies, or, even better, actual instances of its manifestations.


### 3. Offer a window onto the world

Imagine your reader. Talk to her in a confident voice. Present her with an interesting truth about the world, engage her in a conversation, assume equality between you and her, trust her intelligence, and rely on her cooperation in drawing her own conclusions. This ideal is called *classic style*, and it's the best antidote to academic, bureaucratic, corporate and legal writing.

### 4. Avoid self-conscious writing

This can take a variety of forms:

- **Metadiscourse**:
- **Signposting**:
- **Personalizing block of text**:
- **Professional narcissism**:
- **Inward-looking style**:
- **Shudder quotes**:
- **Compulsive hedging**:
- **Excessive use of intensifiers**:
- **Cliches**:
- **Nominalization**: turning verbs into nouns and adjectives
- **unnecessary passives**: 

All of this is tedious. Don't do that.

### 5. More cool rules

- Avoid clichés at all costs. Stale idioms get the reader to shut down her own visual imagery.
- Metaconcepts: words like *level*, *perspective*, *approach*, *assumption*, *concept*, *condition*, *context*, *framework*, *issue*, *model*, *process*, *range*, *role*, *strategy*, *tendency*, *variable* are all abstract 
- Avoid long chunks of monotonous looking text. Break down your content visually
into paragraphs.
- Be clear about your **topic** (what you're talking about) and your **point**
(what are you saying). This should be done as early as possible.
- Beware of synonimomania. Vary wording only when strictly necessary (i.e. if
repetition would be tedious or confusing). Never vary wordings when comparing
things.
- Be aware that your web of knowledge is different from the one of your readers.
Mention given before new.

### 6. When in doubt, connect (but do it once)
Be aware of the coherence relations between sentences and how they can be expressed. Use the right amount of connectives to reconstruct your coherence relations. Use too few connectives and you might confuse the readers. Use too many, and you may sound like stating the obvious and patronizing. This is tricky, as the right amount of connectives depends also from your readers' experience. This is why it's important to share drafts with your readers and look for feedback. Connectives are incredibly important stuff, and are pretty difficult to nail.
