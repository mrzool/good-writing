### 1. Be an avid reader

The first and most important rule. Reading the works of great writers gets you to absorb "a vast inventory of words, idioms, constructions, tropes and rethorical tricks" and helps you develop a sense of how good writing works.

### 2. Use vivid imagery

Abstractions are often tedious and laborious for the human brain to handle. To make your writing pleasant and get your point across, use physical, vivid and concrete images instead. Spice up your writing by using unusual words occasionally. Use [phonaestetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonaesthetics) and be aware of its power. If you need to write about an abstract idea, make it alive with metaphors, analogies, or, even better, actual instances of its manifestations.


### 3. Offer a window onto the world

Imagine your reader. Talk to her in a confident voice. Present her with an interesting truth about the world, engage her in a conversation, assume equality between you and her, trust her intelligence, and rely on her cooperation in drawing her own conclusions. This ideal is called *classic style*, and it's the best antidote to academic, bureaucratic, corporate and legal writing.

### 4. Avoid self-conscious writing

This can take a variety of forms:

- **Metadiscourse**:
- **Signposting**:
- **Personalizing block of text**:
- **Professional narcissism**:
- **Inward-looking style**:
- **Shudder quotes**:
- **Compulsive hedging**:
- **Excessive use of intensifiers**:
- **Cliches**:
- **Nominalization**: turning verbs into nouns and adjectives
- **unnecessary passives**: 

All of this is tedious. Don't do that.

### 5. More cool rules

- Avoid clichés at all costs. Stale idioms get the reader to shut down her own visual imagery.
- Metaconcepts: words like *level*, *perspective*, *approach*, *assumption*, *concept*, *condition*, *context*, *framework*, *issue*, *model*, *process*, *range*, *role*, *strategy*, *tendency*, *variable* are all abstract
